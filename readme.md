# Transmission Blocklist

Many torrent clients have an option to set a Blocklist, which helps protect you from getting caught and having the DMCA send a letter/email.

Using [GitHub Actions](./.github/workflows/auto-build.yml) to  generate blocklist weekly for [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com), available for all platforms.
